Statistics Norway is modernizing its core systems for statistical production. Statistics Norway implements an information model based on the UN standard https://statswiki.unece.org/display/GSIMclick/Clickable+GSIM[GSIM (Generic Statistics Information Model)].

Linked Data Store (LDS) was designed for providing a generic way of handling metadata and data supporting GSIM compliant information models. It is by no means bound to the GSIM domain, so it can be used for any application that requires _structured data_.
